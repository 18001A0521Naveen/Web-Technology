The race began. No one in the crowd really believed the tiny frogs would reach the top of the tower. 
         Heard throughout the race were statements such as, “Oh, way too difficult”, “They will never make it to the top”, “Not a chance they will succeed”, and “The tower is too high”.
         The tiny frogs began collapsing, one by one – except for those who, in a fresh tempo, were climbing higher and higher. The crowd continued to yell, “It is too difficult! No one will make it”!
         More tiny frogs got tired and gave up. But one continued to climb higher and higher. This one refused to give up!</p></article>

         All of the other tiny frogs wanted to know how this one frog managed to do it. They asked him how he had found the strength to succeed and reach the goal.</p>
          
	  <p>It turned out that the winning frog was deaf!</p>
	  
	  <p>If you really want to accomplish something, you can always choose to become deaf, especially when the people around you say negative or discouraging things.</p>
